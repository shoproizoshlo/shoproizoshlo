# Hello! 👋 I am Susanna!

## About me

💡 My passion for crafting impeccable user experiences inspires me to create responsive and interactive interfaces, as well as animations, bringing pages to life with vibrancy and dynamism. I enjoy working with CSS and aim to create visually appealing and unique designs.

💼 I specialize in frontend development using modern technologies such as Vue, Nuxt, React, and Next. My stack includes TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I'm familiar with frameworks and libraries like TailwindCSS and Bootstrap.

📚 Ready to learn new tools and development methodologies, always open to sharing knowledge and experiences with colleagues. I value the opportunity for continuous growth both as a professional and as an individual.

🌐 If you're looking for an energetic and goal-oriented Frontend Developer, ready to take on challenges and contribute to your project, feel free to get in touch with me! I'd be happy to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.
